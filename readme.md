# Astro Web Component Renderer

This is a plugin for [Astro](https://astro.build/) apps that enables server-side rendering of custom elements.

Server-side rendering uses [Declarative Shadow DOM](https://web.dev/declarative-shadow-dom/), a new web technology that allows custom elements to be rendered to HTML with __0 JavaScript__.
